                    <h2>What Is Collagen Protein?</h2>
                    <p>By now, you've probably seen the ads and heard people talking about collagen protein—it's everywhere. But what's all the buzz about? Is it time for you to jump on the bandwagon? And if you've already joined the masses, why should you make the switch to Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein Powder?</p>
                    <p>In order to answer these questions, we first have to answer this one: <strong>What is collagen?</strong></p>
                    <p>Simply put, collagen is the most abundant and arguably the most important protein in the body. In fact, collagen constitutes a whopping 30% of the protein in your body. Aside from water, <strong>collagen is the most plentiful substance in your body</strong>—pretty crazy, right?</p>
                    <p>For example, collagen makes up 70% of the protein in our skin, and it's one of the primary structural proteins in joints, bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, hair, fingernails, the intestinal wall, and more. Collagen is the glue—literally, it comes from the Greek word for glue—that supports, connects, and holds everything together.</p>
                    <p>Not surprisingly, healthy levels of collagen are vital to support:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smooth, healthy, young-looking skin</li><li>Strong, healthy fingernails and glossy hair</li><li>Healthy, supple joints</li><li>Bone health</li><li>Healthy digestion and gut health</li><li>Strong, healthy tendons and ligaments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There's more—including healthy, flexible blood vessels and organ health—but the moral of the story is that collagen is a component of your entire body, and it has a tremendous impact on how you look and feel.</p>
                    <h2>Why Do You Need a Collagen Powder?</h2>
                    <p>When you're young, your body makes all the collagen it needs. That's why your skin is firm and glowing, your joints are supple, and your digestive system works like a champ.</p>
                    <p>So, what happens as you get older? Your body loses its ability to make collagen, and to make matters worse, collagen might reduce more rapidly thanks to things like smoking, stress, excess sun exposure, physical activity, and diet. For example, consuming sugar, refined carbs, and poor-quality fats (such as industrial produced vegetable oils), which are common in processed foods, can all contribute to collagen depletion.</p>
                    <p><strong>In simple terms, we produce less collagen with age.</strong></p>
                    <p>For example, studies show that skin levels of collagen decrease by about 11 - 13% with each passing decade after the age of 20, and by the time folks hit their 80s, collagen levels may be, on average, only one-third of what they were in their 20s.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-md-block"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0009/2900/5634/files/Ageless_Collagen_Graphic.jpg?9115" alt="" width="608" height="407"></p>
                    <p>Over time, this reduction in collagen may contribute to…</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skin sags and wrinkles</li><li>Hair gets thinner, and nails lose their strength</li><li>Joints become stiff and less flexible</li><li>Recovery from activities like exercise slows</li><li>Occasional gut-related complaints come out of nowhere</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That may sound grim, but it's not all bad news. In fact, there's GREAT news. <strong>You can ramp up your body's collagen production by consuming more collagen protein in your diet. </strong></p>

                        <h2>What Is Collagen Protein?</h2>
                        <p>By now, you've probably seen the ads and heard people talking about collagen protein—it's everywhere. But what's all the buzz about? Is it time for you to jump on the bandwagon? And if you've already joined the masses, why should you make the switch to Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein Powder?</p>
                        <p>In order to answer these questions, we first have to answer this one: <strong>What is collagen?</strong></p>
                        <p>Simply put, collagen is the most abundant and arguably the most important protein in the body. In fact, collagen constitutes a whopping 30% of the protein in your body. Aside from water, <strong>collagen is the most plentiful substance in your body</strong>—pretty crazy, right?</p>
                        <p>For example, collagen makes up 70% of the protein in our skin, and it's one of the primary structural proteins in joints, bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, hair, fingernails, the intestinal wall, and more. Collagen is the glue—literally, it comes from the Greek word for glue—that supports, connects, and holds everything together.</p>
                        <p>Not surprisingly, healthy levels of collagen are vital to support:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Smooth, healthy, young-looking skin</li><li>Strong, healthy fingernails and glossy hair</li><li>Healthy, supple joints</li><li>Bone health</li><li>Healthy digestion and gut health</li><li>Strong, healthy tendons and ligaments</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There's more—including healthy, flexible blood vessels and organ health—but the moral of the story is that collagen is a component of your entire body, and it has a tremendous impact on how you look and feel.</p>
                        <h2>Why Do You Need a Collagen Powder?</h2>
                        <p>When you're young, your body makes all the collagen it needs. That's why your skin is firm and glowing, your joints are supple, and your digestive system works like a champ.</p>
                        <p>So, what happens as you get older? Your body loses its ability to make collagen, and to make matters worse, collagen might reduce more rapidly thanks to things like smoking, stress, excess sun exposure, physical activity, and diet. For example, consuming sugar, refined carbs, and poor-quality fats (such as industrial produced vegetable oils), which are common in processed foods, can all contribute to collagen depletion.</p>
                        <p><strong>In simple terms, we produce less collagen with age.</strong></p>
                        <p>For example, studies show that skin levels of collagen decrease by about 11 - 13% with each passing decade after the age of 20, and by the time folks hit their 80s, collagen levels may be, on average, only one-third of what they were in their 20s.</p>
                        <p class="d-none d-md-block"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0009/2900/5634/files/Ageless_Collagen_Graphic.jpg?9115" alt="" width="608" height="407"></p>
                        <p>Over time, this reduction in collagen may contribute to…</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Skin sags and wrinkles</li><li>Hair gets thinner, and nails lose their strength</li><li>Joints become stiff and less flexible</li><li>Recovery from activities like exercise slows</li><li>Occasional gut-related complaints come out of nowhere</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>That may sound grim, but it's not all bad news. In fact, there's GREAT news. <strong>You can ramp up your body's collagen production by consuming more collagen protein in your diet. </strong></p>
